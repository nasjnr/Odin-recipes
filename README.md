Hi Again, I am creating my first website to enable me learn more about HTML
I have learnt so much so far and for the first time I'm feeling very good about something, that is being able to design a website of my own.
Odin is great and I thank them for the opportunity.
I need more pracice and I think this is an opportunity for me to do more and no more about about web development.
